        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <p>I like playing games. I'm only 20 so you can't fault me for not having a life cause I don't.</p>
        <h3>Pets</h3>
        <p>Sadly don't own any :(</p>
        <h3>Why Atlas?</h3>
        <p>I wanted to do something with computer science and found Atlas through a college fair. Now that I have done some school work I'm commited all the way.</p>
        <h3>Future outlook</h3>
        <p>I'd like to be employed just to see how the industry will be like in the first five years. After that I don't really know what to expect since it's beyond me at the moment.</p>
